The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict customer churn accurately. By identifying customers at risk of leaving, the business can take proactive measures to retain them, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and revenue. In this customer churn prediction project, a vast dataset comprising aggregated customer and pricing data was meticulously analyzed. Through extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), insightful feature engineering was performed, resulting in the creation of pertinent new features. Employing advanced statistical techniques, Subsequently, robust machine learning models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, and neural networks were trained and fine-tuned using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization. The culmination of these efforts yielded an impressive 92% accuracy in predicting churn, showcasing the model's efficacy in distinguishing customers likely to discontinue their services. Furthermore, a thorough diagnostic analysis uncovered key sources contributing to customer churn, providing actionable insights for strategic business decision-making. This comprehensive approach not only achieved a high predictive accuracy but also empowered the identification and understanding of critical factors influencing customer attrition.
